# Readme Ponds Layer

The ponds layer was produced using two factor consensus between digital elevation model derivatives from a 2018 USGS QL2 lidar scan and a Normalized Difference Wetness Index from a 2022 4 band NAIP image.  
Ponds seeds were grown from areas that were both "wet" and "flat".  Areas under 200 square meters were removed.  The dataset was manually edited.  This resulted in 150 ponds identified.
